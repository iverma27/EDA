Welcome to the Eczema Detection Agency! 
<br />
In order to use our program correctly, make sure you have downloaded all of the appropriate files. This includes images like num.jpg, draft_3_live.mlx and furtherSteps.m  
For optimal functionality, click the button in the top right corner of the screen that says hide code to see just the live editor. You can then progress through the different questions and answer yes or no regarding your eczema symptoms. After you have received a diagnosis, please follow the instructions and skip to section 5 of the code. This section will tell you about your type of eczema, and there is a drop down in case you have two potential diagnoses or wish to learn more about another type of eczema. 
<br />
If you are diagnosed with nummular or atopic eczema, you may choose to check for redness. In that case, please have a clear picture of the affected area less than 1000x1000 pixels in that folder. Please type in the name of the image. After this, the program will ask you to select the area you wish to analyze via a popup figure. Click an area of the image to begin and continue to click every time you wish to change direction to make a polygon. Make sure you see a circle appear when you are making your final connection in the polygon. After this, you can move the polygon around to better select the area. When you are satisfied with your selection, right click it and click create mask. The program will now be able to calculate the redness. 
<br />
As always, be sure to see a medical professional to confirm your diagnosis and before beginning any treatment options.
